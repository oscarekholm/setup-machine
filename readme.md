Script for setting up my machine in one go üòé

## What does it mean, what does it mean?

![What does it mean?](./what-does-it-mean.gif)

For macOS machines this means installing the following things:

- Brew with Brew Cask
- tmux
- iTerm2
- nvim
- Google Chrome
- Slack
- Spectacle
- Postgres
- prezto
- nvm
- A few basic utils (Github hub, Ag, fzf, imagemagick, thefuck)
- [github.com/oscarekholm/dotfiles](https://github.com/oscarekholm/dotfiles) for configuration of just about all of the above

For other systems, it currently means nothing at all since I haven't yet
gone about implementing installation scripts for them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Bits of the macOS setup script is shamelessly copied from [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop). Kudos.
